# Model4Model6

Disclaimer: This project is complete! Please feel free to use it, but change the code at your own risk. If you would like to test this code on your own model, you only have to update Model4 and Model 6. The code is specifically designed for a master-slave oscillator (Model 6 and Model 4, respectively) which is coupled as one model (JacobsCoupled).

Project Description: This project solves the coupled circadian clock Model 6 and the cell cycle Model 4 as well as plots its Arnold Tongue for various coupling strengths and cell cycle periods (mass doubling times). The arnold tongue is determined by solving the coupled ODE system and determining if the distribution of the last peak values and times between these peaks (for a cell cycle variable) has large standard deviations (setting the period = 0) or small standard deviations (setting the period to time difference between the last two peaks of the cell cycle variable). The file CellCycleHist.m solves the coupled model for a specified coupling strength (ep) and mass doubling time (MDT), before plotting the time distances between all peaks. This allows the user to see more clearly why a certain combination of ep and MDT gives the results seen in ArnoldTongue.m. 

Hopefully the comments in the code are enough to describe the rest of the program. If not, please feel free to e-mail me (bellmajb@mail.uc.edu). Good luck and happy coding!
